+ import a csv file containing a batch of transactions from an exchange
    ? maybe have a config file that maps fields?
+ list last n transations
+ display current value in summary (can fetch from public api). Maybe add --portfolio flag?
+ rather than dir, also accept a filename for transaction file. Maybe check whether it is a file or dir first?
+ export a batch of transactions based on date, currency, etc.
+ add a 'confirmed' field so that unconfirmed transactions can be recorded
+ read settings from a config file/env var (eg. default datastore folder)
? interpret command line args from clipboard, eg. can copy a table from an exchange page?
